# RecipIT

Recip'IT is an iOS application developed by myself. 
This project was made in the context of a tutored project during the last semester of my second-year Computer Science Degree.
This first iOS project allows me to developped and progress in Swift & SwiftUI

## What's RecipIT?
Recip'IT is a recipe application. The user is able to add new recipes with a title, category, ingredients, directives and a picture.
For this project, I decided to use the MVC technique which consists of dividing the Model, View and Controller.

When opening the app, defaults recipe are already set. There were made by a simple class of Model. However, when the user add a new recipe, it will be stock
in a CoreData file. Each recipe can be modified, removed or added to favorites. The favorite filter allows the user to get immediately their favorite recipe.

There is also a category activity where the user can find their recipe depending on the category they add their recipe to.

## More options
This app also allows the user to naviguate through a shopping list where he can add or removed each item of a list. The list gets automatically updated.
